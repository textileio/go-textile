/* A simple PI estimation function using a Monte Carlo method
                      * For 0 to `points`, take 2 random numbers < 1, square and add them to
                      * find the area under that point in a 1x1 square. If that area is <= 1
                      * then it's *within* a quarter-circle, otherwise it's outside.
                      * Take the number of points <= 1 and multiply it by 4 and you have an
                      * estimate!
                      * Do this across multiple processes and average the results to
                      * increase accuracy.
