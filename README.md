## Status

[![Throughput Graph](https://graphs.waffle.io/textileio/go-textile/throughput.svg)](https://waffle.io/textileio/go-textile/metrics/throughput)

This repository contains a the core Textile daemon + command-line client, as well as bindings for mobile (iOS/Android) applications.

See [textile-mobile](https://github.com/textileio/textile-mobile/) for the [Textile Photos](https://www.textile.photos) iOS/Android app.

## What is Textile?

[Textile](https://www.textile.io) provides encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application data storage built on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p). We like to think of it as a decentralized data wallet with built-in protocols for sharing and recovery, or more simply, **an open and programmable iCloud**.

**Please see the [docs](https://docs.textile.io/) for more**.

## Install

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/textileio/go-textile/releases/latest) for your OS or jump to [Docker](https://github.com/textileio/go-textile#docker). You can also install the Textile [desktop tray app](https://github.com/textileio/desktop/releases/latest), which runs a streamlined version of `go-textile` via an easy-to-install Electron app!
