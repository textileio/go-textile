> Textile Tray App

# Project

This project was bootstrapped with Textile's [`textile-react-cookie`](https://github.com/textileio/textile-react-cookie). It was originally generated via [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and then the build/run configuration was customized with a `craco.config.js` file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started), and the [Craco project repo](https://github.com/sharegate/craco).

## Textile

[Textile](https://www.textile.io) provides encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application data storage built on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p). We like to think of it as a decentralized data wallet with built-in protocols for sharing and recovery, or more simply, **an open and programmable iCloud**.

This cookiecutter project is designed to showcase the features of `js-http-client`, which is available on [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@textileio/js-http-client) under the `@textile` scope. `js-http-client` provides access to an underlying `textile-go` node's REST API, adding various simplified APIs to support in-browser and programmatic desktop access. For the most part, the API would mimic the command-line and/or mobile APIs of `textile-go`, with some browser-specific enhancements. It works well in conjunction with the Textile [desktop Tray app](https://github.com/textileio/go-textile#tray-app).
