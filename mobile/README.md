## What is Textile?

[Textile](https://www.textile.io) provides encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application data storage built on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p). We like to think of it as a decentralized data wallet with built-in protocols for sharing and recovery, or more simply, **an open and programmable iCloud**.
